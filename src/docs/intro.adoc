== Intro

Providing test data, especially when attempting to test for a wide
range of inputs is tedious if not impossible to do by hand. Generating
inputs allows for more thorough testing without a dramatic increase in
effort. In Spock
http://spockframework.github.io/spock/docs/1.0/data_driven_testing.html[data
driven tests] can have data provided by any
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterable.html[Iterable]. Spock
Genesis provides a variety of classes that extend from
https://github.com/Bijnagte/spock-genesis/blob/master/src/main/groovy/spock/genesis/generators/Generator.groovy[Generator]
which meet that interface. Where possible the generators are lazy and
infinite.
